The mtree utility compares a file hierarchy against a specification,
creates a specification for a file hierarchy, or modifies a specification.

The default action, if not overridden by command line options, is to
compare the file hierarchy rooted in the current directory against a
specification read from the standard input.  Messages are written to the
standard output for any files whose characteristics do not match the
specification, or which are missing from either the file hierarchy or the
specification.
